# QChem
Reading and Coding about QChem


- Plan to study QChem:
- Pick up where Qidong left off?
- Make sense of the project, start to dig in the libraries and understand the physics.
- Begin to tackle the problem.

- So it seems like it's just a few python notebooks. It might eb good to start with reading and understanding them.
Check out qidong's stuff after APS1
